#### <u>macOS</u>

Use JetBrains' [straight forward installer](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)

#### <u>Linux</u>

Linux setup is a little harder, but is definitely worth it. Download the archive from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux). Extract the files in the archive to somewhere easily accessible, but make sure they are in their own folder. Go into the folder, and run the executable.

### <u>Eclipse</u>
Eclipse is relativley faster, but uses lots of messy project files, and is missing custom theme support. Install instructions not avaliable because this is only recommended for experienced users

### <u>Visual Studio Code</u>
Visual Studio Code is the most performant out of all of them, but can take a lot of effort to set up initially. See install instructions below

#### <u>Universal</u>
Microsoft decided to make it really easy to install on all platforms https://code.visualstudio.com/download
