# <u>Choosing a Java version</u>

To start developing, you'll need to choose a version of java to work with. 

### <u>1.14 - 1.16.5</u>
 For modding 1.14 - 1.16.5, Java 8 (1.8) usually works the best, though Java versions above it work but are unreliable.

 ### <u>1.17+</u>
 Since 1.17 released, you have to use Java 16 to be able to develop or even play those versions.
